# Enlace Privacy Policy

Last Updated: 27 April 2025

## Our Commitment to Your Privacy

Enlace apps are designed to respect your privacy. We do not actively collect, store, or sell your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle any data that may be involved in your use of the app.

## Information We Collect

The only personal information collected is that which is necessary to use the applications. For example, Data Tracker requires an email to use to sign in to use the application.

The app may collect minimal, non-identifiable usage data (e.g., app performance metrics or crash reports) to improve functionality. This data is anonymized and cannot be linked to you as an individual.

## How We Use Information

Any anonymized data collected is used solely to maintain and improve the app’s performance and user experience.

We do not use data for marketing, profiling, or any other purpose beyond app functionality.

## Sharing of Information

No Selling or Sharing: We do not sell, trade, or share any data collected by the app with third parties, except as required by law.

Legal Requirements: If required by law or to protect the safety of users, we may disclose data to authorities, but only to the extent necessary.

## Third-Party Services

The app does not integrate third-party services for the purpose of collecting personal information (e.g., advertising networks or analytics tools).

If future updates include third-party services, we will update this policy and ensure they align with our commitment to privacy.

## Data Security

We implement reasonable measures to protect any data processed by the app from unauthorized access or loss.
Since we collect minimal data, the risk to your privacy is inherently low.

## Children’s Privacy

Enlace apps are not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. Updates will be posted on our website, with the “Last Updated” date revised.
Continued use of Enlace apps after changes indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.
