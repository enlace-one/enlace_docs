# Page Notes Privacy Policy

The Page Notes extension collects no user data in any form outside of what Google Developer Console natively provides. 

While we collect no user data, we find it prudent to clearly state that we do not sell user data or use it for advertising.

At the time this was written, Google Developer Console provided aggregate metrics such as installs over time, installs per operating system, installs per region, and installs per language. It did not provide any Personally Identifiable Information (PII). 

Please see the other privacy polices for the other products and applications.
