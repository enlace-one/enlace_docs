### Clipbox Fails to Copy on Keyboard Shortcut Press
There are several things that may cause this. In general, Chrome seems to work better than Edge but feel free to try other browsers. 

The following steps may help:
- Restart the browser
- Disable/Enable the extension
- Restart the computer
- Uninstall/re-install the extension (This will likely cause data loss)
- You can always try other shortcut combinations as I've found some work even while others don't.
